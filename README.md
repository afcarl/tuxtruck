[![Project Status: Abandoned - Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/abandoned.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

This is a defunct project to create a Linux/Python based feature-packed CarPC
platform. There's very little code here - some stuff for reading OBD and GPS
data, and strangely, code for reading the accelerometer information from
SunSPOTs. 

If you're looking for the later, wxPython version of TuxTruck (referenced on
tuxtruck.org), you're probably looking for my [TuxTruck-wxPython repository](https://github.com/jantman/TuxTruck-wxPython).
