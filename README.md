tuxtruck
========

This is a defunct project to create a Linux/Python based feature-packed CarPC
platform. There's very little code here - some stuff for reading OBD and GPS
data, and strangely, code for reading the accelerometer information from
SunSPOTs. 

If you're looking for the later, wxPython version of TuxTruck (referenced on
tuxtruck.org), you're probably looking for my [TuxTruck-wxPython repository](https://github.com/jantman/TuxTruck-wxPython).
