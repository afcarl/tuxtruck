tuxtruck
========

This is a defunct project to create a Linux/Python based feature-packed CarPC
platform. There's very little code here - some stuff for reading OBD and GPS
data, and strangely, code for reading the accelerometer information from
SunSPOTs. 

What I *do* have is an idea, and a domain name - tuxtruck.org. If anyone is
interested in continuing the project, please contact me.
